# Hello! I’m Jamie!

I’m currently seeking summer internships in Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Data Science.

I'm a sophomore at Stony Brook University pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and a minor in Digital Arts. Through my undergraduate courses, I've honed my skills in object-oriented programming, data structures and algorithms, statistics, graph theory, and combinatorics. I've also gained foundational machine learning knowledge in a summer AI program through Cornell. I actively search for opportunities to apply the skills I've learned, through projects like a Discord-based invite flow project with Phygtl, and a patent classification project with S&P Global. I also enjoy opportunities to apply my love for design by creating custom art for hackathon projects and drawing creative fliers to advertise club events!

As a woman in computer science, I'm grateful to supportive communities like Break Through Tech where female and non-binary students can come together and reach their career goals! I also like taking part in organizing campus events and initiatives through computer science clubs at my university to provide students with the connections and technical skills they need to succeed.
